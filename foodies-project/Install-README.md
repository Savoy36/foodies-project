### 1. Have node.js, npm, and expo xde or exp all installed
    ..* node.js has to be v6.x or later
### 2. As soon as you merge the remote repo with your own, open a terminal in the foodies-project directory and run $ npm install
    ..* This will install node package manager tools in that di
      
### You should now be able to open the project through expo... If you are using the ios/android app, point your camera at the qr code when prompted and then it should then begin to build the JavaScript.
